Reinforcement Learning Tips and Tricks
======================================

The aim of this section is to help you for doing reinforcement learning experiments.
It covers general advice about RL (where to start, which algorithm to choose, how to evaluate an algorithm, ...),
as well as tips and tricks when using a custom environment or implementing an RL algorithm.


General advice when using Reinforcement Learning
================================================

TL;DR
-----

1. Read about RL and Stable Baselines
2. Do quantitative experiments and hyperparameter tuning if needed
3. Evaluate the performance using a separate test environment
4. For better performances, increase the training budget


Like any other subject, if you want to work with RL, you should first read about it (we have a `ressource page <rl.html>`_ to get you started)
to understand what you are using. We also recommend you to read Stable Baselines (SB) documentation and do the `tutorial <https://github.com/araffin/rl-tutorial-jnrr19>`_.
It covers basic usage and guide you towards more advanced concepts of the library (e.g. callbacks and wrappers).

Reinforcement Learning differs from other machine learning methods in different manners. The data used to train the agent is collected
through interactions with the environment by the agent itself (compared to supervised learning where you have a fixed dataset for instance).
This dependence can lead to vicious circle: if the agent collects poor quality data (e.g., trajectories with no rewards), then it will not improve and continue to amass
bad trajectories.

This factor, among others, explains that results in RL may vary from one run to another (i.e., when only the seed of the pseudo-random generator changes).
For this reason, you should always do several runs to have quantitative results.

Good results in RL are usually dependent on finding appropriate hyperparameters. Recent alogrithms (PPO, SAC, TD3) normally require little hyperparameter tuning,
however, *don't expect the default ones to work* on any environment.

We highly recommend you to take a look at the `RL zoo <https://github.com/araffin/rl-baselines-zoo>`_ (or the original papers) for tuned hyperparameters.
A best practice when you apply RL to a new problem is to do automatic hyperparameter optimization. Again, this is included in the `RL zoo <https://github.com/araffin/rl-baselines-zoo>`_.

When applying RL to a custom problem, you should always normalize the input to the agent (e.g. using VecNormalize for PPO2/A2C)
and look at common preprocessing done on other environments (e.g. for Atari, frame-stack, ...).
Please refer to `Tips and Tricks when creating a custom environment` paragraph below for more advice related to custom environments.


Current Limitations of RL
-------------------------

You have to be aware of the current `limitations <https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html>`_ of reinforcement learning.


Model-free RL algorithms (i.e. all the algorithms implemented in SB) are usually *sample inefficient*. They require a lot of samples (sometimes millions of interactions) to learn something useful.
That's why most of the successes in RL were achieved on games or in simulation only. For instance, in this `work <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTDkYFZFWug>`_ by ETH Zurich, the ANYmal robot was trained in simulation only, and then tested in the real world.

As a general advice, to obtain better performances, you should augment the budget of the agent (number of training timesteps).

How to make them more sample efficient? informative (shaped) reward, SRL, initialize with imitation learning,
reduce the number of parameters (e.g. reduce the observation space, action space by constraining it).


In order to to achieved a desired behavior, expert knowledge is often required to design an adequate reward function.
This *reward engineering* (or *RewArt* as coined by `Freek Stulp <http://www.freekstulp.net/>`_), necessitates several iterations. As a good example of reward shaping,
you can take a look at `Deep Mimic paper <https://xbpeng.github.io/projects/DeepMimic/index.html>`_ which combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to do acrobatic moves.

One last limitation of RL is the instability of training. That is to say, you can observe during training a huge drop in performance.
This behavior is particularly present in `DDPG`, that's why its extension `TD3` tries to tackle that issue.
Other method, like `TRPO` or `PPO` make use of a *trust region* to minimize that problem by avoiding too large update.


How to evaluate an RL algorithm?
--------------------------------

Evaluation methodology: use a test env, evaluate periodically the agent, and use deterministic agent to remove exploration noise.
Looking at the training curve (episode reward function of the timesteps) is a good proxy but usually underestimate the agent true performance.

`blog post <https://openlab-flowers.inria.fr/t/how-many-random-seeds-should-i-use-statistical-power-analysis-in-deep-reinforcement-learning-experiments/457>`_

`issue <https://github.com/hill-a/stable-baselines/issues/199>`_

We suggest you reading `Deep Reinforcement Learning that Matters <https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.06560>`_ for a good discussion about RL evaluation.

Which algorithm should I use?
=============================

There is no silver bullet in RL, depending on your needs and problem, you may choose one or the other.
The first distinction comes from your action space, do you have discrete (e.g. LEFT, RIGHT, ...)
or continuous actions (ex: go to a certain speed)?

Some algorithms are only tailored for one or the other domain: `DQN` only supports discrete actions, where `SAC` is restricted to continuous actions.

The second difference that will help you choose is whether you can multiprocess or not your training, and how you can do it (with or without MPI?).
If what matters is the wall clock training time, then you should lean towards `Ã€2C` and its derivates (PPO, ACER, ACKTR, ...).
Take a look at the `Vectorized Environments <vec_envs.html>`_ to learn more about training with multiple workers.

To sum it up:

Discrete Actions
----------------

.. note::

	This covers `Discrete`, `MultiDiscrete`, `Binary` and `MultiBinary` spaces


Discrete Actions - Single Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

DQN with extensions (double DQN, prioritized replay, ...) and ACER are the recommended algorithm.
DQN is usually slower to train (regarding wall clock time) but is the most sample efficient (because of its replay buffer)

Discrete Actions - Multiprocessed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You should give a try to PPO2, A2C and its successors (ACKTR, ACER).

If you can multiprocess the training using MPI, then you should checkout PPO1 and TRPO.


Continuous Actions
------------------

Continuous Actions - Single Process
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Current State Of The Art (SOTA) algorithms are `SAC` and `TD3`.
Please use the hyperparameters in the `RL zoo <https://github.com/araffin/rl-baselines-zoo>`_ for best results.


Continuous Actions - Multiprocessed
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Take a look at PPO2, TRPO or A2C. Again, don't forget to take the hyperparameters from the `RL zoo <https://github.com/araffin/rl-baselines-zoo>`_
for continuous actions problems (cf *Bullet* envs).

.. note::

  Normalization is critical for those algorithms

If you can use MPI, then you can choose between PPO1, TRPO and DDPG.


Goal Environment
-----------------

If your environment follows the `GoalEnv` interface (cf `HER <her.html>`_), then you should use
HER + (SAC/TD3/DDPG/DQN) depending on the action space.


.. note::

	The number of workers is an important hyperparameters for experiments with HER. Currently, only HER+DDPG supports multiprocessing using MPI.



Tips and Tricks when creating a custom environment
==================================================

If you want to learn about how to create a custom environment, we recommend you to read this `page <custom_envs.html>`_.
We also provide a `colab notebook <https://colab.research.google.com/github/araffin/rl-tutorial-jnrr19/blob/master/5_custom_gym_env.ipynb>`_ for
a concrete example of creating a custom environment.

Some basic advice:

- always normalize your observation space when you can (when you know the boundaries)
- normalize your action space and make it symmetric when continuous (cf potential issue below)
	A good practice is to rescale your actions to lie in [-1, 1].
	This does not limit you as you can easily rescale the action inside the environment
- start with shaped reward (i.e. informative reward) and simplified version of your problem
- debug with random actions to check that your environment works and follows the gym interface:


Here is a code snippet to check that your environment runs without error.

.. code-block:: python

	env = YourEnv()
	obs = env.reset()
	n_steps = 10
	for _ in range(n_steps):
		# Random action
		env = env.action_space.sample()
		obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)


Why should I normalize the action space?

Tips and Tricks when implementing an RL algorithm
=================================================

- read the paper several times
- read online implementation (if available)
- careful with the shapes (e.g. broadcast value fn) and the gradient
- tools to debug: explained variance
- first sign of life on a simple problem then try harder and harder (usually need hyperparameter tuning)
- what to monitor: entropy (exploration/exploitation), log std, stability (reduce learning rate, linear schedule)
  exploration pb: augment the noise/ entropy coefficient

what not to monitor: actor loss
